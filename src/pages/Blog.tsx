        <h2>New Portfolio Site! (March 3, 2024)</h2>
        <p>
          I'm back! This site is pretty old, so I finally decided to build a new
          portfolio site! This will probably be my last blog post here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new site is much more oriented towards selling myself as a
          web-developer, a proper portfolio showcasing my skills. To be honest,
          I don't feel all that capable as a web-dev just yet, but this archaic
          site certainly wasn't helping.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose to leave out the blog section in the new site because 1) this
          "blog" is moreso just a diary with my mundane ramblings, not worth
          reading I think, and 2) does anyone even read these in the first
          place? I could be writing to myself for all I know. If anyone's
          reading this and you want me to continue making these posts for some
          reason, I suppose you can message me (maybe using the email form in my
          new site :D).
        </p>

        <p>
          You can see my new site{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"

            here
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I actually finished the Reddit clone I mentioned in the last
          update! It's called Reddot (very original, I know) and you can visit
          it{" "}
          <a

          >
            here
          </a>
          . It's also featured in my new site. Sorry to those who bet I would
          100% the Batman Arkham trilogy first; So far I have 100% in Arkham
          Asylum, about 90% in City, and about 80% in Knight ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, if anyone's reading this, thanks for tuning in. It's the end for
          this site, but the beginning of my professional career.

          Alright, it's been a long while since my last update here. I'm not
          going to lie, I kind of forgot this site even existed ðŸ˜…. So what's
          new?
        </p>
        <p>
          To start, I'm already about half-way through my internship at{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"
            href="https://www.energytoolbase.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Energy Toolbase
          </a>
          . I've learned a lot about how to work in a real-world web
          application, and have made some notable contributions to both the
          front-end and the back-end. See the site's dashboard for an example:
        </p>
        <div>
          <img src="/assets/images/etb_dashboard.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          See those pretty charts? I made those. We were using the old version
          of a data visualization library and I was tasked with adding the
          latest version, designing the class structure, and adding those charts
          as the first from the new version. There were many steps along the
          way, including figuring out how to add the new version in the first
          place (this wasn't trivial), how to have it coexist with the old
          version (it was too onerous to update all our charts to the new
          version), and how to obtain the data that goes in these charts.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's more that I touched in that screenshot: that proposal table
          below the charts, I made that. Well... I largely copied the format
          from other tables in the site, so admittedly this isn't much. But that
          sidebar on the right? I refactored the CSS to remove many redundant
          lines and improved its responsiveness!
        </p>
        <p>
          And there are countless other places in the site I touched. It kinda
          feels surreal, knowing that people are using this application, using
          UI elements that I made, code that I wrote. This is the real deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's still much more to learn in the latter half of the internship.
          I'm looking forward to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, enough about the internship. How am I doing on the
          self-learning front?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd say I'm doing alright, but I definitely could be doing better. I
          say that because I've still yet to build a full-stack project! In
          fact, I haven't made a project since the memory game. I made that...
          like, an entire year ago. However, I think I've gathered enough
          knowledge to make a little something: I'm currently building a Reddit{" "}
          <s>bootleg</s> clone. It's a little ambitious for my first full-stack
          project, but having spent this long without making anything, I would
          expect I can pull this off. If I get stuck or bored and drop this
          project, you can at least expect another project on a smaller scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see, my self-learning progress kinda came to a screeching halt
          thanks to the{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"
            href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Steam Deck
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <div>
          <img src="/assets/images/steam-deck.jpg" />
        </div>
        <p>
          This is the best and worst purchase I've ever made. It's
          revolutionized how I play games. Games that I'd never touch on my PC,
          I play on the Deck. Do you know how wild it feels to play something
          like Fallout 4 on a handheld? I can play that and more in the comfort
          of my bed, on-the-go, or wherever else I please. It's so convenient.
          And it has killed my productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm slowly getting back on the self-learning grind, but there are
          still days where I spend all my free time in bed playing the Batman
          Arkham trilogy. Then again, why not indulge myself? Genshin Impact
          isn't going to play itself...
        </p>
        <p>
          I suppose I'll end this update here. Make your bets now: will I 100%
          the Reddit project before I 100% all 3 Batman Arkham games?
        </p>

        <h2>First Week at Energy Toolbase (May 6, 2023)</h2>
        <p>
          Just a quick update to record my experiences in the first week of my
          internship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people here are so nice and helpful! There are actually a couple
          colleagues that have interned here. One has been interning for a year
          now, another has interned but is returning as an employee, and another
          has interned a long time ago and is now a high-ranking member. The
          retention of these people can only mean good things for my time here
          :)
        </p>
        <p>
          I've actually seen some of the tools used by my team in my University
          courses and personal use, which was interesting. For example, I used{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"
            href="https://www.notion.so/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Notion
          </a>{" "}
          mainly to take course notes, but my team uses it to document
          everything about our projects. Another example is{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"
            href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Jira
          </a>
          : I had only used it to simulate bug-reporting as well as agile
          sprints. My team actually uses Jira in a similar way, but goes further
          with functionalities I'm not yet familiar with. It's nice to already
          have foundations for the tools I'm using, since I don't have as much
          catch-up to do ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, my work was delayed when I ate an office lunch that was
          offered in the kitchen. I was careless, and unknowingly picked out
          some food items that had nuts in them. I'm allergic to certain kinds
          of nuts, you see, so it only took 1 bite and the sting on my tongue to
          realize that something was wrong. The ensuing reaction took me out of
          commission for the entire rest of the day and the day afterwards.
          Heck, even now I'm still experiencing a lack of appetite. It's like
          the reaction gave my stomach PTSD.
        </p>
        <p>
          But at least I was able to work enough afterwards that I completed my
          first ticket &gt;:) A colleague reviewed the code, so now all that's
          left is for someone to do QA and then I can merge it into the main
          branch! Feels exciting making a contribution to a real project.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that's the plan for next week, finish this ticket and see what
          other tickets I can do to ramp up. Minus the office lunch incident,
          this week went pretty well! I'm looking forward to viewing this post
          in a year and seeing how far I've come... but I should focus on next
          week for now ;)
        </p>

        <h2>Surviving the Winter Term (May 1, 2023)</h2>
        <p>
          Well... this term has certainly been an adventure. It's been a long
          time since the last update, but I had to focus on staying afloat in a
          torrent of assignments, projects, and exams. It's time to rest these
          weary bones, and share some interesting results while I'm at it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start with SENG 401, one of this term's courses that was about
          software architecture. We were given a group project to complete over
          the term: a web-based application that demonstrates the use of
          architectures and databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          My group settled on an online player vs. player game. Ambitious was an
          understatement; we envisioned a realtime combat system, complete with
          a chat, a friend system, skins, and even a gacha system (what?).
        </p>
        <p>
          We started building this project as a full-stack application, using
          React for the frontend with Express JS and MongoDB as the main backend
          tools. It went fine for a while; as I already had some experience with
          those tools, I was able to get a realtime chat system working - far
          into the term, that is. This pace would not suffice, but we only
          realized this fact once two-thirds of the term had passed...
        </p>
        <p>
          There just was not enough time for the others to learn backend
          development and implement all the server requirements of this project.
          With only a third of the term remaining, we talked over our options.
          We then came to a startling revelation:
        </p>
        <p>
          Why didn't we just use{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"
            href="https://firebase.google.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Firebase
          </a>
          ? Why did we want to make a full-stack application when most of us
          didn't even have any experience with the backend? Was it because we
          thought we had time to learn it as we go? Was it so we could put more
          technologies on our resume? Either way, our plan was flawed and we
          lost a lot of time for it. There was only one option we had if we
          wanted to finish our project on time: scrap our backend and just use
          Firebase.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who don't know, Firebase is a BaaS (Backend as a Service)
          that offers ready-to-use solutions for common application features.
          These include authentication, a no-SQL database, file storage, and
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          See, I thought it would be painful to redo my work in Firebase, but
          guess what? I redid the chat system in a single day (in fact, over the
          span of two lectures). Makes me think of how much time and stress we
          could have saved if we just used Firebase from the beginning. Sigh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, we used the other Firebase services to implement the rest of
          our application at breakneck speeds, finishing up right before the due
          date.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our game is called I'm Slime. It has all the features I mentioned
          before, the player vs. player combat, chat, skins, the gacha. It's
          quite a step up from my other portfolio projects, so I'm pretty proud
          of it. Check out our demo video below:
        </p>
        <div className="iframe-container">
          <iframe
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F0mAtFBdw5w"

            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
          >
            {" "}
          </iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
          It was a wild ride, but we learned a lot of lessons from this project.
          One, backend work should not be underestimated. Two, Firebase is
          incredibly useful for quickly developing applications. Three,
          developing in a large group takes coordination and communication to
          work effectively! I'll add the demo link some point after we get our
          final grades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, I already wrote a page just on one course, so let's move on to a
          different one, CPSC 471 (Database Management Systems). Again, we had
          to develop a web-based application, but this one focuses on
          demonstrating the use of a database. We decided to use Postgres as the
          DBMS since it's conveniently hosted on Supabase.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project went far more smoothly than the SENG 401 one. Although we
          had to develop the backend, the requirements for this project were
          much smaller. Add to this the fact that our server calls were simple
          CRUD calls to execute SQL queries (which we already learned in the
          course), we didn't have to learn much more to get the backend working.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, we developed an application called Dee Too Ell (please don't
          sue), an educational platform where administrators can create forms
          for students to complete. These forms can be evalations, such as
          surveys for a course/instructor, or they can be quizzes to assess
          student performance. It's not as flashy as the 401 project, but it
          demonstrates good full-stack application development with SQL usage.
          Like with the other project, I'll add the link here eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other courses were not as eventful. They were certainly hectic
          (kiwi) but nothing that's worth reporting here. However, if you are
          curious, I additionally took CPSC 441 (Computer Networks), SENG 438
          (Software Testing, Reliability, and Quality), and SENG 471 (Software
          Requirements Engineering).
        </p>
        <p>
          That about wraps up the school term update. I actually wrote this a
          week ago but forgot to push the changes, so this is getting posted on
          the first day of my internship... ah well. Expect another update soon

        <h2>Crushing the Fall Term (December 14, 2022)</h2>
        <p>
          The last weeks of this fall term have been hectic, but I just finished
          my only final and can now rest. Some exciting things have happened
          since my last update.
        </p>
        <p>
          For one, I earned the prestigious{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"
            href="https://ucalgary.ca/registrar/awards/louise-mckinney-scholarship"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Louise Mckinney award
          </a>
          ! This is awarded to 350 students across all faculties with
          exceedingly high academic merit in the past fall and winter terms.
          I've heard others say I need at least a 4.0 GPA to even qualify for
          this award, so I thought I was doomed when I got a 3.97 GPA last year
          (curse you, ENDG 319!) Imagine my surprise when I got the
          congratulations in my inbox! I suppose last year was rough for
          everyone such that there were far fewer 4.0s, making room for my
          candidacy - that, or my 6 A+'s raised my qualifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I'm happy to report I crushed the courses this fall term as I've
          stated in the header! These are CPSC 457 (operating systems), ENCM 511
          (embedded system interfacing), ENSF 480 (software design), and GRST
          211 (medical terms, an optional course).
        </p>
        <p>
          CPSC 457 in particular might just be my favorite course, period - I
          had so much fun solving the assignment programming questions and
          learning about optimization techniques used in operating systems. If I
          did my last few assignments as well as the rest, this may well be one
          of my highest-graded courses too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm expecting to finish all four of these courses with A+'s, putting
          me in a good position to perhaps go for another Louise Mckinney &gt;:)

          Setting aside my schoolwork, I participated in my second-ever
          hackathon: Hack the Change 2022! It was rough since my group members
          and I had no experience with back-end development, which we absolutely
          needed to make a presentable project. I had to learn Firebase, a BaaS
          (Backend as a Service), in about two days. We produced{" "}

          , a site where users can donate to charities and view aggregated
          thank-you messages from the charities and people they helped! Feel
          free to check it out; I wrote the user authentication, database, and
          API usage code. We didn't earn any prizes, but we did well given the
          circumstances.

        <p>
          That about wraps up this update. Over this winter break, I intend to
          learn about full-stack development, which will be doubly useful as
          next term's courses include databases and servers. Happy holidays,
          everyone, and stay tuned!

          Two Internship Applications. One Interview. One Offer. (October 14,
          2022)
        </h2>
        <p>I still don't believe what happened.</p>
        <p>
          Just two weeks ago, I was accepted into my{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"

            university's internship program.
          </a>{" "}
          Essentially, my fourth academic year will be delayed to my fifth, and
          in the interim I'll work as a paid intern. I was to find a 12-16 month
          internship, or series of internships totalling that length by
          September 2023; in other words, I had 11 months to find an
          arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
          From what I heard, the internship hunt was hell. You apparently had to
          beef up your resume beforehand with work and volunteer experience.
          Want to know how much work experience I had? Zero. Zilch. Never worked
          a day in my life. And my volunteer experience? One program way back in
          2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, you were also supposed to attend company info sessions,
          job fairs, and industry panels. Yeah, I did none of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now say your resume was good enough to impress the ATS and the hiring
          manager. Great! Now you had to pass the interview(s). Want to know how
          much interview experience I had? One 20-minute phone interview where I
          was tested on topics I knew little to nothing about. I wouldn't even
          count it as interview experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can already tell, circumstances weren't particularly in my
          favor. I really only had two strengths I could sell: my academic
          achievements and my self-taught web development skills. So, I
          emphasized my GPA and the awards I've earned on my resume, and
          included some of my best web dev projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm happy to report that this strategy worked. Of the first and only
          two applications I sent, one company responded and asked for an
          interview!
        </p>
        <p>
          I was surprised, but more so I was happy; happy that my resume was
          capable of earning an interview in the first place. That means I
          should be able to earn more interview opportunities from the many more
          applications I would send, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then came the interview. Considering that I didn't expect an interview
          so soon, I had little time to prepare. However, I felt I still
          answered the questions intelligently. Some responses were shaky, but
          others I absolutely nailed.
        </p>
        <p>
          They told me they would let me know next week if I had passed... but I
          learned that I passed the following day.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was the only interview, too. I had expected more phases, but was
          told that was it. The internship spans 16 months, so in a flash I've
          already fulfilled the program's length requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          So. Given 11 months to find an internship, I took two weeks. I'm
          overjoyed to have earned a spot in a company I would love to work for,
          having learned about their work culture and the things I'll do.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm proud that all the effort I put into my studies and web
          development stood up against other applicants with who knows how much
          work and interview experience. I'm proud that I was able to defy the
          odds and achieve this dream-like outcome. I won't deny that luck
          played a part, but I recognize the colossal amount of work I put in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next year, you'll find me interning at{" "}
          <a

            Energy Toolbase
          </a>
          . I'm not resting just yet for I'll continue my self-learned web
          development journey, less to put projects on my resume and more to
          prepare for this internship. My professional career is off to a strong
          start. Stay tuned!

        <h2>The Fall Term Approaches (August 29, 2022)</h2>
        <p>
          Hey look, now I have a blog section! Since I haven't yet learned about
          backend web development and databases, I'm hard-coding these entries
          for now. I've also included older text that I used to have on my main
          page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, only a week remains before I return to the university for my
          third year. I think I made a <em>lot</em> of progress this summer,
          having gone from knowing almost nothing to being able to make somewhat
          presentable sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I didn't learn about just web development either; I went a step
          further and learned{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"
            href="https://neovim.io/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Neovim
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          What's Neovim, you ask? It's a modal text editor that uses the
          keyboard only - no mouse necessary (though it does still support it).
          It's known to increase your editing speed since anything done with the
          mouse is now done with efficient key combinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can vouch for the speed increase; After learning Neovim I wish that
          all other programs would use the Neovim editing system...
        </p>
        <p>
          Though, two things prevent me from switching to Neovim as my main
          editor: one, setting up IDE features is a pain. See, Neovim is not an
          IDE but can be extended with plugins to act like one. I can't live
          without VS Code's awesome features, but I can't be bothered to
          reproduce them all in Neovim. Two, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux,
          where I can run Neovim) has a problem where my development tools'
          watch features don't work. That is, they're unresponsive when normally
          they'd recompile my project after any changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, I use the middle-ground solution:{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"
            href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            VSCode Neovim
          </a>
          , a plugin that integrates a Neovim instance into VSCode. There are
          bugs and compromises, but it's the best solution I can find.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's to hoping that I can use my new editing skills in my courses.
          Wish me luck as I enter my third year!

        <h2>Making Progress (July 22, 2022)</h2>
        <p>
          I decided to learn web development over the summer and started this
          personal website on June 15. Since then, I've been working through{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"
            href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            The Odin Project's curriculum
          </a>{" "}
          (a fantastic place to learn web dev, I should add) and completed some
          of the projects. You'll find some of these here on the main page and
          the rest on the projects page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I return to my university for the Fall term, I hope to expand
          my skills beyond simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! However, that is
          easier said than done, as my forays into web development tools have so
          far proven troublesome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, it's nice to see the progress I've made reflected on this
          site. You'll notice a few changes here and there, such as typography
          improvements. Just recently, I added overlays over the project images
          so that you may view a project or its source code :).
        </p>
        <p>
          Check back later - I may (or may not) have made further changes as my
          skills improve...

        <h2>Site Under Construction! (June 15, 2022)</h2>
        <p>
          This site doesn't have much to it, but that's because I've only just
          started self-learning web development. In fact, this is one of my
          first attempts at making a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I used a template from{" "}
          <a
            className="link link--underline"
            href="https://html5up.net/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            HTML5 UP
          </a>
          . While it looked better to an extent, my attempts at personalization
          resulted in some <em>janky</em> layouts. I wanted to make my own
          website from scratch, even if it looks worse still; I could then
          personalize it exactly the way I wanted and (eventually) make it look
          good. Furthermore, it would serve as a personal project to perhaps
          impress employers ;).
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the first iteration of my self-made website. By summer's end,
          I will probably (hopefully [maybe]) have a decent website going
          here...

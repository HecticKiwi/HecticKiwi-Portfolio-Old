          <h2>Crushing the Fall Term (December 14, 2022)</h2>
          <p>The last weeks of this fall term have been hectic, but I just finished my only final and can now rest. Some exciting things have happened since my last update.</p>
          <p>For one, I earned the prestigious <a class="link link--underline" href="https://ucalgary.ca/registrar/awards/louise-mckinney-scholarship" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Louise Mckinney award</a>! This is awarded to 350 students across all faculties with exceedingly high academic merit in the past fall and winter terms. I've heard others say I need at least a 4.0 GPA to even qualify for this award, so I thought I was doomed when I got a 3.97 GPA last year (curse you, ENDG 319!) Imagine my surprise when I got the congratulations in my inbox! I suppose last year was rough for everyone such that there were far fewer 4.0s, making room for my candidacy - that, or my 6 A+'s raised my qualifications.</p>
          <p>Also, I'm happy to report I crushed the courses this fall term as I've stated in the header! These are CPSC 457 (operating systems), ENCM 511 (embedded system interfacing), ENSF 480 (software design), and GRST 211 (medical terms, an optional course).</p>
          <p>CPSC 457 in particular might just be my favorite course, period - I had so much fun solving the assignment programming questions and learning about optimization techniques used in operating systems. If I did my last few assignments as well as the rest, this may well be one of my highest-graded courses too.</p>
          <p>I'm expecting to finish all four of these courses with A+'s, putting me in a good position to perhaps go for another Louise Mckinney &gt;:)</p>
          <p>Setting aside my schoolwork, I participated in my second-ever hackathon: Hack the Change 2022! It was rough since my group members and I had no experience with back-end development, which we absolutely needed to make a presentable project. I had to learn Firebase, a BaaS (Backend as a Service), in about two days. We produced <a class="link link--underline" href="https://devpost.com/software/lilac-9zylug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lilac</a>, a site where users can donate to charities and view aggregated thank-you messages from the charities and people they helped! Feel free to check it out; I wrote the user authentication, database, and API usage code. We didn't earn any prizes, but we did well given the circumstances.</p>
          <p>That about wraps up this update. Over this winter break, I intend to learn about full-stack development, which will be doubly useful as next term's courses include databases and servers. Happy holidays, everyone, and stay tuned!</p>

          <h2>Two Internship Applications. One Interview. One Offer. (October 14, 2022)</h2>
          <p>I still don't believe what happened.</p>
          <p>Just two weeks ago, I was accepted into my <a class="link link--underline" href="https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/current-students/undergraduate/launching-your-career/engineering-internship-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">university's internship program.</a> Essentially, my fourth academic year will be delayed to my fifth, and in the interim I'll work as a paid intern. I was to find a 12-16 month internship, or series of internships totalling that length by September 2023; in other words, I had 11 months to find an arrangement.</p>
          <p>From what I heard, the internship hunt was hell. You apparently had to beef up your resume beforehand with work and volunteer experience. Want to know how much work experience I had? Zero. Zilch. Never worked a day in my life. And my volunteer experience? One program way back in 2016.</p>
          <p>In addition, you were also supposed to attend company info sessions, job fairs, and industry panels. Yeah, I did none of that.</p>
          <p>Now say your resume was good enough to impress the ATS and the hiring manager. Great! Now you had to pass the interview(s). Want to know how much interview experience I had? One 20-minute phone interview where I was tested on topics I knew little to nothing about. I wouldn't even count it as interview experience.</p>
          <p>As you can already tell, circumstances weren't particularly in my favor. I really only had two strengths I could sell: my academic achievements and my self-taught web development skills. So, I emphasized my GPA and the awards I've earned on my resume, and included some of my best web dev projects.</p>
          <p>I'm happy to report that this strategy worked. Of the first and only two applications I sent, one company responded and asked for an interview!</p>
          <p>I was surprised, but more so I was happy; happy that my resume was capable of earning an interview in the first place. That means I should be able to earn more interview opportunities from the many more applications I would send, right?</p>
          <p>Then came the interview. Considering that I didn't expect an interview so soon, I had little time to prepare. However, I felt I still answered the questions intelligently. Some responses were shaky, but others I absolutely nailed.</p>
          <p>They told me they would let me know next week if I had passed... but I learned that I passed the following day.</p>
          <p>That was the only interview, too. I had expected more phases, but was told that was it. The internship spans 16 months, so in a flash I've already fulfilled the program's length requirements.</p>
          <p>So. Given 11 months to find an internship, I took two weeks. I'm overjoyed to have earned a spot in a company I would love to work for, having learned about their work culture and the things I'll do. </p>
          <p>I'm proud that all the effort I put into my studies and web development stood up against other applicants with who knows how much work and interview experience. I'm proud that I was able to defy the odds and achieve this dream-like outcome. I won't deny that luck played a part, but I recognize the colossal amount of work I put in.</p>
          <p>Next year, you'll find me interning at <a class="link link--underline" href="https://www.energytoolbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Energy Toolbase</a>. I'm not resting just yet for I'll continue my self-learned web development journey, less to put projects on my resume and more to prepare for this internship. My professional career is off to a strong start. Stay tuned!</p>

          <h2>The Fall Term Approaches (August 29, 2022)</h2>
          <p>Hey look, now I have a blog section! Since I haven't yet learned about backend web development and databases, I'm hard-coding these entries for now. I've also included older text that I used to have on my main page.</p>
          <p>Anyways, only a week remains before I return to the university for my third year. I think I made a <em>lot</em> of progress this summer, having gone from knowing almost nothing to being able to make somewhat presentable sites.</p>
          <p>And I didn't learn about just web development either; I went a step further and learned <a class="link link--underline" href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Neovim</a>.</p>
          <p>What's Neovim, you ask? It's a modal text editor that uses the keyboard only - no mouse necessary (though it does still support it). It's known to increase your editing speed since anything done with the mouse is now done with efficient key combinations.</p>
          <p>I can vouch for the speed increase; After learning Neovim I wish that all other programs would use the Neovim editing system...</p>
          <p>Though, two things prevent me from switching to Neovim as my main editor: one, setting up IDE features is a pain. See, Neovim is not an IDE but can be extended with plugins to act like one. I can't live without VS Code's awesome features, but I can't be bothered to reproduce them all in Neovim. Two, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux, where I can run Neovim) has a problem where my development tools' watch features don't work. That is, they're unresponsive when normally they'd recompile my project after any changes.</p>
          <p>Thus, I use the middle-ground solution: <a class="link link--underline" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VSCode Neovim</a>, a plugin that integrates a Neovim instance into VSCode. There are bugs and compromises, but it's the best solution I can find.</p>
          <p>Here's to hoping that I can use my new editing skills in my courses. Wish me luck as I enter my third year!</p>

          <h2>Making Progress (July 22, 2022)</h2>
          <p>I decided to learn web development over the summer and started this personal website on June 15. Since then, I've been working through <a class="link link--underline" href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Odin Project's curriculum</a> (a fantastic place to learn web dev, I should add) and completed some of the projects. You'll find some of these here on the main page and the rest on the projects page.</p>
          <p>Before I return to my university for the Fall term, I hope to expand my skills beyond simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! However, that is easier said than done, as my forays into web development tools have so far proven troublesome.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, it's nice to see the progress I've made reflected on this site. You'll notice a few changes here and there, such as typography improvements. Just recently, I added overlays over the project images so that you may view a project or its source code :).</p>
          <p>Check back later - I may (or may not) have made further changes as my skills improve...</p>

          <h2>Site Under Construction! (June 15, 2022)</h2>
          <p>This site doesn't have much to it, but that's because I've only just started self-learning web development. In fact, this is one of my first attempts at making a website.</p>
          <p>Previously, I used a template from <a class="link link--underline" href="https://html5up.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HTML5 UP</a>. While it looked better to an extent, my attempts at personalization resulted in some <em>janky</em> layouts. I wanted to make my own website from scratch, even if it looks worse still; I could then personalize it exactly the way I wanted and (eventually) make it look good. Furthermore, it would serve as a personal project to perhaps impress employers ;).</p>
          <p>This is the first iteration of my self-made website. By summer's end, I will probably (hopefully [maybe]) have a decent website going here...</p>

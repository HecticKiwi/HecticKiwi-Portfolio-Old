      <h1>This site is a work in progress!</h1>
      <p>This site doesn't have much to it, but that's because I've only just started self-learning web
        development. In fact, this one of my first attempts at making a website.</p>
      <p>Previously, I used a template from HTML5 UP. While it looked better to an extent, my attempts at
        personalization resulted in some janky layouts. I wanted to make my own website from scratch, even if it looks
        worse still; I could then personalize it exactly the way I wanted and (eventually) make it look good. Furthermore,
        it would serve as a personal project to perhaps impress employers ;).</p>
      <p>This is the first iteration of my self-made website. By summer's end, I will probably (hopefully [maybe]) have a
        decent website going here...</p>

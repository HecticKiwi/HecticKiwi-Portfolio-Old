      <h2>The Fall Term Approaches (August 29, 2022)</h2>
      <p>Hey look, now I have a blog section! Since I haven't yet learned about backend web development and databases, I'm hard-coding these entries for now.</p>
      <p>Anyways, only a week remains before I return to the university for my third year. I think I made a <em>lot</em> of progress this summer, having gone from knowing almost nothing to being able to make somewhat presentable sites.</p>
      <p>And I didn't learn about just web development either; I took it a step further and learned <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>.</p>
      <p>What's Neovim, you ask? It's a modal text editor that uses the keyboard only - no mouse necessary (though it does still support it). It's known to increase your editing speed since you don't waste time moving your hand to and from the mouse.</p>
      <p>I can vouch for the speed increase; After learning Neovim I wish that all other programs would use the Neovim editing system...</p>
      <p>However, two things hold me back from switching to Neovim as my main editor: one, setting up IDE features is a pain. See, Neovim is not an IDE but can be extended with plugins to act like one. I can't live without VS Code's awesome features, but I can't be bothered to reproduce them all in Neovim. Two, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux, where I can run Neovim) has a problem where my development tools' watch features don't work. That is, they're unresponsive when normally they would recompile my project after any changes.</p>
      <p>Thus, I use the middle-ground solution: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim">VSCode Neovim</a>, a plugin that integrates a Neovim instance into VSCode. There are bugs and compromises, but it's the best solution I can find.</p>
      <p>Here's to hoping that I can use my new editing skills in my courses. Wish me luck as I enter my third year!</p>

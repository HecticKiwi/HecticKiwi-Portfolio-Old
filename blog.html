      <h2>The Fall Term Approaches (August 29, 2022)</h2>
      <p>Hey look, now I have a blog section! Since I haven't yet learned about backend web development and databases, I'm hard-coding these entries for now. I've also included older text that I used to have on my main page.</p>
      <p>Anyways, only a week remains before I return to the university for my third year. I think I made a <em>lot</em> of progress this summer, having gone from knowing almost nothing to being able to make somewhat presentable sites.</p>
      <p>And I didn't learn about just web development either; I went a step further and learned <a class="link link--underline" href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank">Neovim</a>.</p>
      <p>What's Neovim, you ask? It's a modal text editor that uses the keyboard only - no mouse necessary (though it does still support it). It's known to increase your editing speed since anything done with the mouse is now done with efficient key combinations.</p>
      <p>I can vouch for the speed increase; After learning Neovim I wish that all other programs would use the Neovim editing system...</p>
      <p>Though, two things prevent me from switching to Neovim as my main editor: one, setting up IDE features is a pain. See, Neovim is not an IDE but can be extended with plugins to act like one. I can't live without VS Code's awesome features, but I can't be bothered to reproduce them all in Neovim. Two, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux, where I can run Neovim) has a problem where my development tools' watch features don't work. That is, they're unresponsive when normally they'd recompile my project after any changes.</p>
      <p>Thus, I use the middle-ground solution: <a class="link link--underline" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim" target="_blank">VSCode Neovim</a>, a plugin that integrates a Neovim instance into VSCode. There are bugs and compromises, but it's the best solution I can find.</p>
      <p>Here's to hoping that I can use my new editing skills in my courses. Wish me luck as I enter my third year!</p>

      <h2>Making Progress (July 22, 2022)</h2>
      <p>I decided to learn web development over the summer and started this personal website on June 15. Since then, I've been working through <a class="link link--underline" href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard" target="_blank">The Odin Project's curriculum</a> (a fantastic place to learn web dev, I should add) and completed some of the projects. You'll find some of these here on the main page and the rest on the projects page.</p>
      <p>Before I return to my university for the Fall term, I hope to expand my skills beyond simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! However, that is easier said than done, as my forays into web development tools have so far proven troublesome.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it's nice to see the progress I've made reflected on this site. You'll notice a few changes here and there, such as typography improvements. Just recently, I added overlays over the project images so that you may view a project or its source code :).</p>
      <p>Check back later - I may (or may not) have made further changes as my skills improve...</p>

      <h2>Site Under Construction! (June 15, 2022)</h2>
      <p>This site doesn't have much to it, but that's because I've only just started self-learning web development. In fact, this is one of my first attempts at making a website.</p>
      <p>Previously, I used a template from <a class="link link--underline" href="https://html5up.net/" target="_blank">HTML5 UP</a>. While it looked better to an extent, my attempts at personalization resulted in some <em>janky</em> layouts. I wanted to make my own website from scratch, even if it looks worse still; I could then personalize it exactly the way I wanted and (eventually) make it look good. Furthermore, it would serve as a personal project to perhaps impress employers ;).</p>
      <p>This is the first iteration of my self-made website. By summer's end, I will probably (hopefully [maybe]) have a decent website going here...</p>
